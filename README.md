# Analyze A/B Test Results

### Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree (DAND) - Period: completed in June 2020.

## Introduction

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these.

## Project Scope

For this project, you will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an **e-commerce website**. Your goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The data and the Jupyter Notebook, which are all of the files you need to complete the project, are provided for you in a downloadable zip file in the resources tab (as well as under "Supporting Materials" below). Note that portions of the notebook reference back to quizzes that are linked in this lesson to ensure you are on the right track.

Supporting Material can be found [here](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/December/5a32c9a0_analyzeabtestresults-2/analyzeabtestresults-2.zip)

## Check the Project Rubric
If you're on this page, then you should have completed the Jupyter Notebook, downloaded a .html copy of the document, and be ready to submit the report for review. If that's the case, congratulations! Read on to the points below for some final checks before you submit your project.

Your project will be evaluated by a Udacity reviewer according to this [Project Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/37e27304-ad47-4eb0-a1ab-8c12f60e43d0/rubric). Be sure to review it thoroughly before you submit. Your project "meets specifications" only if it meets specifications in all the criteria. If you see room for improvement in any category in which you do not meet specifications, be sure to take some time to revise your work until you feel it meets the expectations in the rubric. In particular, there is one section of the rubric that focuses on the quality of your code. It is not just important that you are able to obtain the correct answers, but it is also important that you have followed good coding practices to obtain your solutions.
